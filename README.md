# PostIQ
Functional Requirements Document
Project Name: LinkedIn Content Performance Analyzer MVP
Overview
The goal of this MVP is to provide LinkedIn professionals with a simple and intuitive tool to track and analyze the performance of their LinkedIn posts. This tool will track engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments), provide sentiment analysis of comments, forecast future post performance, and offer personalized recommendations for improving LinkedIn content strategy.
The MVP will follow a modular, incremental development approach to ensure each feature can be tested and deployed quickly. The app will be built with React.js/Next.js, OpenAI GPT, and also Ollama (if it’s better, faster and free) for sentiment analysis, and the tech stack will follow best practices for scalable, maintainable code.

•	Why: Provides users with an easy-to-read snapshot of their LinkedIn post performance.
3. Sentiment Analysis
•	Feature: Sentiment analysis on the comments and reactions to each LinkedIn post.
o	Sentiment APIs: Use OpenAI GPT or Claude/Ollama for NLP sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).
o	Display Sentiment: Show sentiment analysis results next to each post's engagement metrics.
•	Why: Understanding the tone of audience feedback helps users tailor their content and improve engagement.
4. Trend Forecasting
•	Feature: Predict future post performance based on historical engagement data.
o	Forecasting Model: Use simple regression models or data analysis to forecast post performance.
o	Graphs/Trends: Show trends (e.g., post reach, engagement rate) for future posts based on data.
•	Why: Helps users understand what content types or posting times might work best in the future.
5. Personalized Recommendations
•	Feature: Provide tailored recommendations to improve LinkedIn content strategy.
o	Content Tips: Suggest content types (e.g., video vs text), post timings, and hashtags that work based on user engagement data.
o	Personalized Alerts: Notify users when to post content for maximum engagement based on historical trends.
•	Why: Users need actionable insights to enhance their LinkedIn strategy and increase engagement.
6. Payment System (Premium Features)
•	Feature: Implement subscription management for premium features like sentiment analysis and trend forecasting.
o	Free Tier: Limit users to tracking up to 5 posts per month with basic engagement data.
o	Premium Tier: Charge a monthly fee for unlimited access to sentiment analysis, trend forecasting, and personalized recommendations.
•	Why: Monetizes the MVP by offering valuable premium features.
7. LinkedIn Post Integration
•	Feature: Allow users to input their LinkedIn post URLs or automatically import posts using LinkedIn API.
o	Manual Input: Allow users to manually input post URLs or directly paste content to track.
o	API Integration: If possible, integrate with LinkedIn's API to fetch user posts and engagement data.
•	Why: Ensures the tool automatically tracks user LinkedIn content and pulls real-time engagement data.

Development Roadmap (Incremental Steps)
Given the limited time frame (1-2 hours), we will break down the MVP into small, manageable tasks that can be completed step by step. Each stage will focus on a core feature and will progressively build up the app until it’s ready for deployment.
________________________________________
Step 1: Set Up the Basic Infrastructure
1.	Create Bolt.new Project: Start with a clean slate and choose the basic template.
o	Set up React.js/Next.js app structure with pages for the Dashboard, Login, and Subscription sections.
o	Install necessary dependencies (React, Next.js, Firebase for backend storage, Stripe for payment).
________________________________________
Step 2: User Authentication
1.	Integrate LinkedIn OAuth (or manual email/password) for user registration and login.
o	Bolt.new can handle this with API calls to the LinkedIn OAuth API.
o	Create the basic user interface for logging in, sign-up, and handling authentication.
2.	User Dashboard Setup:
o	Set up a simple user dashboard page where users can see their posts and engagement metrics.
o	Use React components to display posts (dummy data for now).
________________________________________
Step 3: Engagement Metrics & Graphs
1.	Post Engagement Tracking:
o	Dummy data for initial testing: Display likes, comments, shares (manually inputted).
o	Use React Chart.js or similar library to display engagement trends.
o	Display data in a bar chart or line graph to visualize performance over time.
2.	Basic Engagement Metrics:
o	Use hardcoded data or dummy posts for engagement metrics and display them in a simple table or card.
________________________________________
Step 4: Integrate Sentiment Analysis
1.	Integrate OpenAI GPT/Claude/Ollama for sentiment analysis:
o	Use OpenAI API or Claude for analyzing comment sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
o	Show sentiment alongside engagement data on the post.
2.	Display Sentiment:
o	Color code the sentiment (e.g., green for positive, red for negative) in the user interface.
________________________________________
Step 5: Trend Forecasting
1.	Basic Forecasting Algorithm:
o	Implement a simple trend forecasting function that uses basic regression (historical engagement data) to predict future engagement.
o	Display the forecasted engagement as a line graph.
________________________________________
Step 6: Premium Features & Payment System
1.	Set Up Payment Flow:
o	Integrate Stripe for premium subscriptions (e.g., for sentiment analysis and trend forecasting).
o	Offer a Free Tier for basic features and a Premium Tier for full access.
2.	Payment Page:
o	Set up a simple Stripe integration to handle payments for premium features.
o	Users can upgrade to premium after the free trial ends.
________________________________________
Step 7: Testing & Feedback
1.	Deploy MVP: Once the MVP is functional, deploy it using Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
2.	Collect Feedback: Share the app with early users and gather feedback to iterate on features.
________________________________________
Best Practices in Architecture & Code
•	Modular Design: Each component (e.g., authentication, engagement metrics, sentiment analysis) should be modular and reusable.
•	State Management: Use React Context or Redux for managing global state, especially for user data and post data.
•	API Integration: Keep API calls separate in service files to improve maintainability.
•	Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling, especially with external API calls (LinkedIn API, OpenAI API).
•	Security: Ensure user authentication is secure with OAuth tokens and store user data securely in the backend (Firebase or Airtable).
